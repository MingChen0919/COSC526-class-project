28386116	 we experimentally validated the effect of destabilising mutations in the 5′ utrs of bcl2 and cxcl14 and one stabilising mutation in the 5′ utr of taok2
28386116	 to evaluate the accuracy of the in silico results, one stabilising mutation in the 5′ utr of taok2 (tao kinase 2), one destabilising mutation in the 5′ utr of bcl2 (b-cell lymphoma 2) and two adjacent destabilising mutations in the 5′ utr of cxcl14 (c-x-c motif ligand 14) were selected for experimental validation
28386116	it has been well demonstrated that the over-expression of bcl2 proto-oncogene contributes to the resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis27
28386116	 our bioinformatics analysis identified a guanine to adenine point mutation in a patient with malignant lymphoma, which was predicted to destabilise the rna g4 in the 5′ utr of bcl2 (supplementary table 2)
28386116	 it has been previously shown that the bcl2 rna g4 is very stable near physiological ionic and ph conditions and acts as a translational repressor in the 5′ utr of the bcl2 proto-oncogene28
28386116	 to assess to what extent the mutation can destabilise the bcl2 rna g4, in silico, in vitro and in cellulo evaluations were conducted
28386116	 however, rnafold does not predict any g4 structure for the mutated bcl2 g4 sequence, whereas qgrs-mapper predicts a g4 structure with two g-tetrads (fig

28386116	 cd spectra of wild-type and mutated bcl2 rna g4 oligos were recorded in near physiological ph and potassium concentration
28386116	 cd melting at 260 nm was performed to compare the stability of wild-type and mutated bcl2 rna g4 oligos (fig
28386116	luciferase reporter assays were performed to evaluate the impact of the identified bcl2 point mutation on this rna g4’s function in vitro
28386116	 three constructs were generated by cloning full-length wild-type, g4-mutant and g4-deleted 5′ utrs of bcl2 immediately downstream of a t7 promoter and upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (fig
28386116	 3d), which supports the notion that the rna g4 in the 5′ utr of bcl2 act as a translational repressor
28386116	 compared to the wild-type, a guanine to adenine point mutation in the 5′ utr of bcl2 resulted in a significant increase in translation efficiency (p < 0
28386116	although in silico analysis using rnafold and in vitro luciferase reporter assay have been performed in the context of the entire 5′ utr of bcl2, we repeated the biophysical studies using 62-mer oligos of the wild-type and mutated bcl2 rna g4 that had 20 extra nucleotides from each side (supplementary table 1) to investigate if the flanking sequences can affect the g4 structure and stability
28386116	 these observations suggest that even in the presence of the flanking sequences, wild-type and mutated bcl2 rna g4 oligos fold into g4 structures, however, the mutated g4 is less stable

28386116	 we found 33 rna g4 destabilising and 21 stabilising mutations and selected one stabilising mutation in the 5′ utr of taok2, one destabilising mutation in the 5′ utr of bcl2 and two adjacent destabilising mutations in the 5′ utr of cxcl14 to validate experimentally
28386116	bcl2 is a human proto-oncogene and belongs to the bcl-2-family of proteins
28386116	 many examples exist where the expression of bcl2 is elevated in human malignancies, particularly lymphomas
28386116	 several mechanisms contribute to the overexpression of bcl2, including chromosomal translocations and loss of endogenous micrornas that repress bcl2 expression37
28386116	 in addition, it has been demonstrated that cis-regulatory mutations contribute to the dysregulation of the bcl2 expression38
28386116	 comparison between cd melting curves and tm values of the wild-type and mutated bcl2 rna g4 show that the mutation destabilises this rna g4 (fig
28386116	 in addition, we observed that the difference between tm values of the 62-mer wild-type and mutated oligos are almost the same as the 22-mer oligos (table 1) denoting that the flanking sequence of bcl2 rna g4 does not interfere with this g4 structure and stability
28386116	 we observed ~75% increase in the gene expression at the protein level for the bcl2 g4-mutant construct, whereas there is not a significant difference in the gene expression at the mrna level between the bcl2 g4-mutant and wild-type constructs
28386116	 taken together, these results suggest the guanine to adenine point mutation in one of the g-tetrads of bcl2 rna g4 does not completely disrupt the g4 structure, but significantly decreases its stability and affects its regulatory capability as a translational repressor in the 5′ utr of the bcl2 proto-oncogene
28382141	 however, the expression status, clinical and prognostic effect of combined overexpression of myc and bcl2 in extranodal nk/t-cell lymphoma, nasal type (enktl) are not known
28382141	materials and methods: paraffin-embedded lymphoma samples from 53 patients with newly diagnosed enktl were studied using immunohistochemistry for myc and bcl2, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) for myc and bcl2 were done on 5 tissue sections with highest percentages of both myc and bcl2 positive lymphoma cells
28382141	 fish analysis was performed on 5 tissue sections with dhs of 2, and none of them had myc or bcl2 rearrangement
28382141	 however, patients with tumor localized in extranasal sites seemed to have higher expression of bcl2 and higher dhs than nasal lesions (p=0
28382141	 in univariate survival analysis, either high expression of myc or bcl2 was significantly correlated with inferior pfs and os (p<0
28382141	 however, both the protein products, myc and bcl2 can be overexpressed through other mechanisms without translocation of both genes[15]
28382141	 green et al has shown that immunohistochemical double-hit score (dhs, based on expression status of myc and bcl2 protein) can predict strongly the outcomes of patients with dlbcl treated with rituximab plus chop (rchop) independent of gene translocations [15]
28382141	 enktl, an ebv-associated lymphoma, is featured by overexpression of latent membrane protein-1 (lmp-1)[16], which has been demonstrated to be able to induce the expression of both myc and bcl2
28382141	 however, the expression status, clinical and prognostic effect of combined overexpression of myc and bcl2 in enktl are not known
28382141	 the staining pattern for myc protein was distinctly nuclear, whereas staining for bcl2 protein showed a well-defined cytoplasmic staining pattern
28382141	fish analysis was performed on 5 tissue sections with highest percentages of both myc and bcl2 positive lymphoma cells using break apart fish dna probes for c-myc/8q24 and bcl2/18q21 (probes y5410, y5407
28382141	 thus, patients with both myc of more than 20% and bcl2 of more than 70% had a dhs of 2
28382141	 fish analysis was performed on 5 tissue sections with dhs of 2, and none of them had myc or bcl2 rearrangement

28382141	nk/t-cell lymphoma tissues stained for myc and bcl2 protein (photographed at 200 magnifications)
28382141	 the myc staining is mainly nuclear (a and c), whereas staining for bcl2 is predominantly a cytoplasmic pattern (b and d)
28382141	2, either high expression of myc or bcl2 was significantly correlated with inferior pfs and os (p<0
28382141	 patients with positive expression percentage >20% for myc (a, b) or >70% for bcl2 (c, d) have significantly inferior pfs and os
28382141	as yet, it was known that lmp-1 can exert anti-apoptotic activity and promote proliferation by up-regulation of the expression of bcl2 and myc[23]
28382141	bcl2 is a central anti-apoptotic gene, and the overexpression has been found to be a marker of poor prognosis in several studies[24]
28382141	in this study, we performed combined detection of bcl2 and myc protein expression by immunohistochemistry method to investigate the clinical correlations in newly diagnosed enktl
28382141	 we found that either high expression of myc or bcl2 was significantly correlated with inferior pfs and os, which is consistent with that previously reported [26,24,15]
28382141	 in addition, no myc or bcl2 rearrangement was observed on 5 tissue sections with dhs of 2 through fish analysis, so other oncogenic mechanisms beside myc or bcl2 translocation are likely to be involved in upregulation of myc and bcl2 protein expression in enktl[15]
28382141	 using nk-92 cell line (weak expression of lmp-1), we demonstrated increased expression of both myc and bcl2 after transfection of lmp-1 into nk-92 cell line (supplement figure 1), which supported our hypothesis that ebv infection could induce expression of myc and bcl2 independent of gene translocations

28382095	 bcl2 was not a prognostic factor in tn breast cancer regardless of epidermal growth factor receptor expression
28382095	the prognostic influence of bcl2 was different across molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and it was largely dependent on hr, her2, ki-67, and the stage of cancer
28382095	 bcl2 had a strong favorable prognostic impact only in hr(+)/her2(â€“) or luminal a and luminal b/her2(â€“) subtypes, particularly in advanced stages
28382095	 further investigations are needed to verify the prognostic influence of bcl2 on molecular subtypes of breast cancer and to develop clinical applications for prognostication using bcl2
28382095	 the bcl2 protein, encoded by the bcl2 gene, is the founding member of the bcl2 family of regulator proteins that regulate cell death (apoptosis), by either inducing (proapoptotic) or inhibiting (antiapoptotic) apoptosis
28382095	 bcl2 is the key antiapoptotic protein and its gene is thus classified as an oncogene in general [2]
28382095	 although bcl2 was originally found in human follicular b cell lymphoma carrying the chromosomal translocation t(14,18) [3], researchers have also reported its roles in other cancers such as leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer, among others [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
28382095	reports describing the prognostic role of bcl2 in patients with breast cancer have been published since 1994 [9, 10, 11]
28382095	 [12] reported that bcl2 is an independent predictor of favorable outcomes in breast cancer, particularly in the first 5 years after diagnosis
28382095	 [13] reported that high bcl2 expression is associated with a number of good prognostic factors and is independently associated with a better clinical outcome for patients with lymph node-positive breast carcinoma
28382095	 several meta-analyses have shown that bcl2 is an independent favorable prognostic marker in breast cancer [15, 16]
28382095	 although inconsistent results have been reported, bcl2 has been considered a favorable prognostic factor in breast cancer
28382095	 previously, we also reported that bcl2 was a powerful independent prognostic factor in breast cancer and that favorable clinicopathologic features and a strong correlation with the hormonal receptor (hr) were suggested as the causes of superior survival in patients with bcl2-positive breast cancer [17]
28382095	 compared to unselected breast cancer, the prognostic influence of bcl2 on molecular subtypes of breast cancer has rarely been reported, but the results have been inconsistent and remain controversial
28382095	 moreover, the reported results regarding the prognostic role of bcl2 in triple negative breast cancer (tnbc) have been contradictory
28382095	although the majority of recent studies have reported the favorable prognostic role of bcl2 in unselected breast cancer, its role in molecular subtypes of breast cancer including tnbc has rarely been reported and the results remain controversial
28382095	 in the present study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic influence of bcl2 on molecular subtypes of breast cancer
28382095	 bcl2 was defined as negative when the results of immunohistochemical stains were positive in less than 10% of observed tumor cells and the intensity of staining was weak or lower
28382095	 otherwise, bcl2 was defined as positive
28382095	 a detailed description of the definition of bcl2 positivity was provided in our previous report [17]
28382095	clinicopathologic characteristics according to bcl2 expression in molecular subtypes of breast cancerthe mean follow-up period was 70

28382095	prognostic influence of bcl2 according to stage of breast cancerwe found that the prognostic influence of bcl2 was associated with the stage of breast cancer
28382095	 the prognostic effect of bcl2 increased as the stage of breast cancer advanced (figure 3)
28382095	 in the hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype, although bcl2 was not a significant prognosticator in stage i, it was a significant prognosticator in stage ii, and it was more significant in stage iii
28382095	 in hr(+)/her2(+) and hr(âˆ’)/her2(âˆ’) subtypes, bcl2 was only a significant prognosticator in stage iii
28382095	 in hr(âˆ’)/her2(+) subtype, bcl2 was not a significant prognosticator in any stages (figure 4)
28382095	we found that bcl2 was a strong prognostic factor in the hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype and luminal a and luminal b/her2(âˆ’) subtypes
28382095	 bcl2 had a marginal prognostic effect on the hr(+)/her2(+) subtype and luminal b/her2(+) subtypes
28382095	 bcl2 was not a prognosticator in hr(âˆ’)/her2(+) or her2 subtype, or hr(âˆ’)/her2(âˆ’) or tn subtype
28382095	 we also found that the effect of bcl2 on molecular subtypes was more prominent in advanced stages and that bcl2 became a significant prognosticator in stage iii for hr(+)/her2(+) and hr(âˆ’)/her2(âˆ’) subtypes as well as hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype, although it was still not a prognostic factor in hr(âˆ’)/her2(+) subtype
28382095	 bcl2 was not a prognostic factor in tnbc regardless of the expression of egfr
28382095	although there have been rare previous reports on the prognostic role of bcl2 in molecular subtypes of breast cancer published to date, the results have been inconsistent and controversial
28382095	 [16] reported that bcl2 is an independent indicator of favorable prognosis for all types of early-stage breast cancer including tnbc
28382095	 although they reported that bcl2 was a favorable prognostic factor regardless of er, pr, and her2, bcl2 was not analyzed according to the combination of hr(+) and her2(âˆ’)
28382095	 [24] reported that bcl2 expression was an independent, favorable prognostic factor only in breast cancer patients with the hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype and that bcl2 was not a significant prognostic factor in the other subtypes, including hr(+)/her2(+), hr(âˆ’)/her2(+), and hr(âˆ’)/her2(âˆ’) subtypes
28382095	in the present study, the prognostic influence of bcl2 in unselected breast cancer patients was largely consistent with that reported in previous studies [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 25, 26], including our previous report [17]
28382095	 bcl2 was a powerful favorable prognostic factor in terms of both os and bcss, and the bcl2-positive group showed more favorable clinicopathologic features than the bcl2-negative group in all subgroups, with the exception of nodal positivity alone
28382095	 in subgroup analyses, bcl2 was a favorable prognosticator in all subgroups, with the exception of the negative lymphovascular invasion subgroup, and bcl2 was a significant prognostic factor in both univariate and multivariate analyses
28382095	6% of all patients with breast cancer, excluding an unknown subtype, the strong prognostic effects of bcl2 in unselected breast cancer patients is supposed to be largely re-flected by that of the hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype even though bcl2 was found to have no prognostic effect in the hr(âˆ’)/her2(+) subtype (10
28382095	 as previously reported, favorable clinicopathologic features and strong correlation with hr were suggested as the causes of superior survival in patients with bcl2-positive breast cancer [17] and these factors could partly explain the causality between the expression of bcl2 and the prognoses in molecular subtypes in breast cancer
28382095	the prognostic influence of bcl2 was more prominent with more advanced stage from stage i to stage iii (figure 3)
28382095	 in stage i, bcl2 had no significant prognostic impact on any subtypes, even hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype
28382095	 in stage ii, bcl2 was a significant prognosticator only in hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype
28382095	 in stage iii, bcl2 became a significant prognosticator in all subtypes except for hr(âˆ’)/her2(+) subtype
28382095	 in hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype, prognostic effects of bcl2 were more prominent in stage iii than stage ii (figure 4)
28382095	 as mentioned above, the prognostic effect of bcl2 is presumed to be dependent on the expression of hr and her2
28382095	 bcl2 did not become a significant prognosticator even in stage iii for hr(âˆ’)/her2(+) subtype, although it did become a significant prognostic factor in stage iii for hr(+)/her2(+) and hr(âˆ’)/her2(âˆ’) subtypes
28382095	 in the earlier stages, as the prognostic impact of the stage itself might be stronger, the prognostic influence of bcl2 might be less prominent
28382095	 with the same hypothesis, the prognostic role of bcl2 could be more prominent in the advanced stage for each molecular subtype
28382095	in the present study, bcl2 was not a significant prognosticator in unselected tnbc in terms of os (figure 1, supplementary figure 1)
28382095	 bcl2 was not a significant prognostic factor in egfr(+) or egfr(âˆ’) tnbc
28382095	 although the prognostic role of bcl2 in tnbc has been recently reported, the results have been highly inconsistent to date

28382095	 [29] reported that although bcl2 expression was not associated with any clinicopathologic parameters and did not affect patient survival in tnbc, bcl2 expression showed a significant association with worse os and disease free survival in the nonbasal (claudin-low
28382095	 [30] reported that high bcl2 expression is a significant independent predictor of poor outcomes in tnbc patients treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy, and high egfr protein expression is associated with poor bcss in patients with tnbc treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, especially in basal-like (core
28382095	 further investigations will be required to elucidate the prognostic association between bcl2 and tnbc
28382095	the present study showed the prognostic role of bcl2 in each molecular subtype and each stage of breast cancer in a relatively large group of subjects
28382095	 clinically, bcl2 could be considered one of the important prognosticators in hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype
28382095	 in the advanced stage, the application of bcl2 as a prognosticator could be expanded to not only hr(+)/her2(âˆ’), but also hr(+)/her2(+) and hr(âˆ’)/her2(âˆ’) subtypes
28382095	 second, we could not analyze the impact of bcl2 on the subgroups of tnbc such as core type and claudin-low type because of limited data regarding ck5/6
28382095	 third, we were unable to analyze the influence of bcl2 according to the percentage or intensity of immunohistochemical staining for bcl2 because we could only collect final interpreted results regarding bcl2 immunohistochemistry
28382095	 it is our hope that additional investigations could further clarify our results, and we expect that it will be possible to verify the mechanism of action by which bcl2 influences the prognosis of breast cancer in the near future
28382095	in conclusion, the prognostic influence of bcl2 was different across molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and it was dependent on the expression of hr, her2, and ki-67, as well as stage
28382095	 bcl2 had a strong prognostic impact in hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) and luminal a and luminal b/her2(âˆ’) subtypes, particularly in advanced stages, but it had no effect in hr(â€“)/her2(+) or her2 subtypes, even in advanced stages
28382095	 bcl2 had an intermediate effect in hr(+)/her2(+) and luminal b and hr(âˆ’)/her2(âˆ’) or tn subtypes, and bcl2 was a significant prognostic factor for these subtypes only in stage iii tumors
28382095	 bcl2 had no prognostic impact in tnbc regardless of egfr expression
28382095	 although favorable clinicopathologic features of the hr(+)/her2(âˆ’) subtype could explain the majority of causality for the prognostic role of bcl2, further investigations are needed to verify the prognostic influence of bcl2 on molecular subtypes of breast cancer and to develop clinical applications of bcl2 for prognostication in each molecular subtype of breast cancer

28321348	 in aggressive b-cell nhl, the importance of myc and bcl2 proto-oncogene coexpression (as assessed by immunohistochemistry) and high-grade histologic features are particularly noteworthy
28321348	 we report a unique case of spontaneous remission in a patient with an aggressive b-cell nhl which harbored high-risk histopathologic features, including myc protein expression at 70–80%, bcl2 protein expression, and morphologic features suggestive of high-grade b-cell lymphoma, nos (formerly b-cell lymphoma unclassifiable with features intermediate between diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and burkitt lymphoma [bclu])
28321348	 in one study, patients with increased myc protein expression, particularly when coupled with high expression of the antiapoptotic protein bcl2 as assessed by immunohistochemistry (ihc), experienced a median overall survival of only 3-4 years despite receiving curative-intent chemotherapy with r-chop [7]
28321348	 myc (70–80% positive), bcl2 (greater than 95% positive), and bcl6 (greater than 95% positive) proteins were strongly expressed
28321348	we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of spontaneous remission in an aggressive nhl harboring the poor prognostic features of myc and bcl2 protein coexpression
28321348	 with the improvements in ihc and other molecular and genetic testing, it is certainly feasible that prior reported cases of spontaneous remission in hgbl and dlbcl may have also demonstrated myc and bcl2 coexpression that went undiscovered
28321348	 coexpression of the myc and bcl2 proteins in dlbcl, newly defined as double-expressor dlbcl (de dlbcl), is associated with significantly poorer overall survival (os) and progression-free survival in patients who received curative-intent chemotherapy with r-chop compared to patients without coexpression [7, 10, 17]
28291789	 we showed recently that la protects cells against cisplatin treatment by stimulating the protein synthesis of the anti-apoptotic factor bcl2

28291789	 at this point, we do not know whether the less efficient binding of la to bcl2 mrna in c2

28212447	 the poor outcome of double-hit dlbcl, defined by rearrangements affecting the myc locus in combination with another breakpoint, mainly bcl2, appears to be the result of the combination of myc and bcl2 overexpression [21–23]
28212447	 while double-hit dlbcl is relatively uncommon, found in 5–10% of cases, concurrent high expression of myc and bcl2 proteins by ihc, termed double-expressor lymphoma (del), is detected in approximately 20% of dlbcl [22,24,25]
28212447	 indeed, some studies have shown that b-cell lymphomas with concurrent myc and bcl2 abnormalities, other than translocations, appear to behave similarly to myc/bcl2 double-hit lymphomas [27–29]
28212447	 we demonstrate that concurrent high expression of myc and bcl2 by ihc is positively correlated with previously studied markers of activated bcr signaling

28193280	 this conclusion is also supported by our findings showing positive correlations of bcl2 with alk, sox11, and n-myc scores in ucss, since bcl2 expression is closely associated with neuroendocrine differentiation in some tumors [41, 42]
28193280	another interesting finding in this study was that h251-alk#16 cells treated with doxorubicin showed a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells, along with stabilization of exogenous alk and increased endogenous pakt and bcl2 expression
28193280	 given the fact that akt itself is able to prevent caspase activation by maintaining mitochondrial integrity through regulation of the bcl2 family, [36, 47] it is likely that the alk/akt/bcl2 axis may act as a modulator of apoptosis in ucss

28061782	 evaluations of the myc gene and the bcl2 gene shows good results, however, there is a fair agreement by kappa coefficient, indicating the need for caution in assessing the markers with the immunohistochemical method
28061782	immunohistochemical evaluation of myc, bcl2 and bcl6 is a problem discussed by several hematopathology groups [12, 22–24]
28061782	 [24] studied the immunohistochemical expression of myc and bcl2 of 106 patients diagnosed with dlbcl, correlating their data with prognosis
28061782	 [26] evaluated 336 patients with dlbcl by immunohistochemistry and fish, and found a high specificity (approximately 90%) of positivity for myc and bcl2 in the immunohistochemistry in relation to fish positivity for myc and bcl2 translocations, favoring its potential use for stratification in cases of dlbcl with aggressive behavior [26]
28061782	 they found that myc translocation and bcl2 immunohistochemical expression were independent prognostic factors and must be investigated at the initial diagnosis [15]
28061782	in this study, the “starry sky” morphological pattern, in the dlbcl context, positive immunohistochemistry for myc in over 50% of cells, and positive immunohistochemistry for bcl2 above 70% are indicated as potential selector parameters for patients eligible for cytogenetic study

28056107	 finally, we observed increased bcl2 expression in l-lep cells that could be responsible for the blockage of becn1-mediated autophagy
28056107	 in contrast, we observed that, in l-lep skin lesion cells, bcl2 (b-cell cll/lymphoma 2) represented a hindrance to autophagy together with an inhibition of the autophagic flux, restored via ifn-γ treatment
28056107	 whereas in l-lep lesions, a higher expression of bcl2 was determined, which inhibits autophagy by binding and sequestering becn1 from the class iii pik3 complex [49]
28056107	 to investigate this process, the becn1 and bcl2 protein levels in leprosy skin lesions were assessed by western blot
28056107	 in contrast, bcl2 levels were significantly increased in l-lep versus t-lep lesions (fig 6a)
28056107	 cells were fixed and labeled for becn1 (red), bcl2 (green) and dapi (blue)
28056107	 cytoplasmatic bcl2 colocalizes with becn1 in l-lep mΦs, but not in t-lep mΦs
28056107	 colocalization profiles between cytosolic bcl2 dots and becn1 were quantified and expressed as percentage of cell area
28056107	 the expression of nuclear compartment-associated bcl2 was excluded from the analysis
28056107	 the bcl2 protein has been reported to localize in various cell compartments, including the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum (er), and mitochondrial membranes, but only er-targeted bcl2 is able to inhibit autophagy [49,50]
28056107	 in skin-derived t-lep mΦs, we observed bcl2 expression mainly at the level of the nuclei in the absence of association with cytoplasmatic becn1 staining (fig 6b)
28056107	 however, besides the bcl2 nuclear labeling in skin-derived l-lep mΦs, cytosolic bcl2 dots in colocalization with becn1 expression were seen, which might represent er-targeted bcl2 (fig 6b)
28056107	 collectively, these results provide evidence that overexpressed bcl2 impaired becn1-dependent autophagy in l-lep skin lesion mΦs, contributing to the increased bacillary load
28056107	in l-lep lesions, bcl2 was upregulated, as previously described [66]
28056107	 it has also been shown that cells stably expressing bcl2 could inhibit starvation-induced autophagy via disruption of the becn1/class iii pik3 complex or antagonisms of other as-of-yet-defined becn1 activities that are necessary for autophagy [49,67]
28056107	 it has recently been proposed that the autophagy inhibition mediated by anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members requires dissociation of the becn1 binding, and occurs independently of the pro-apoptotic bcl2 family members bax and bak1 [68]
28056107	 thus, our data suggest that becn1 mediates autophagy in t-lep cells but that bcl2 may inhibit this effect in l-lep cells
28056107	 parkin-dependent mitophagy is antagonized by pro-survival members of the bcl2 family, bcl2l1, and mcl1 [69]

28050299	the positivity for cd99 and bcl2 in this case suggests that the tumor is quite different from classic myofibroblastic proliferations, such as nodular fasciitis, fibromatosis, and dermatofibroma, as well as from benign and malignant smooth muscle proliferations, which are all uniformly negative for these antigens

28049506	 the reduced expression of bcl2 and bclxl in our investigation suggests that 3c-induced apoptosis is mediated by an inhibition of these proteins

28018176	 based on the known roles of bcl2 and hsp60 in cell apoptosis and mitochondrial metabolism, the observed upregulation of these factors by gdnf suggests that gdnf protects neurons against ogd-induced injury, possibly by regulating cell apoptosis
28018176	 based on research showing that hsp60 up-regulates bcl2 and attenuates cell death (ghribi et al
28018176	, 2003), we speculate that the detailed mechanism of this protection involves the regulation of bcl2 and hsp60 by gdnf, possibly via the mitochondria apoptosis pathway

28005952	 we observed that hoxd10, bcl2 and pgr are the most important factors affected in primary prostate samples, whereas, in the metastatic state, stat3, jun and junb are playing a central role
28005952	 regulation of bcl2 by pgr through direct binding to its promoter has been reported before [40,41]
28005952	 bcl2 is an anti-apoptotic onco-protein
28005952	 increased expression of bcl2 contributes to tumorigenicity, poor clinical prognosis and resistance to chemo- and radiation-therapy in many tumors [42,43]
28005952	 up-regulation of bcl2 correlates with progressed levels of prostate cancer but the exact role of bcl2 in prostate cancer is not explicit
28005952	 bcl2 and pgr are targeted by overexpressed mirnas in the integrative regulatory network (mir-25, mir-375 and mir-548c-3p for bcl2, and mir-19a and mir-19b for pgr)
28005952	 based on the regulatory network analysis of primary prostate tumor, hoxd10, bcl2 and pgr are 3 key elements in the network
28005952	 except for bcl2 all these genes are tfs

27990281	18) translocation in follicular lymphomas1,2, demonstration that bcl2 inhibits cell death3,4, realization that bcl2 is elevated in cll5,6, recognition that bcl2 and its anti-apoptotic paralogs bind bh3-only proteins through their bh3-binding grooves7, identification of abt-737 and navitoclax as bh3-binding groove-directed inhibitors of bcl2 and bclxl8,9, demonstration that navitoclax is active against cll10, and derivation of venetoclax as a bcl2-selective bh3 mimetic11
27990281	 to provide context for these ongoing efforts, we review recent progress in understanding the action of bcl2 family proteins, summarize the clinical status of venetoclax and other bh3 mimetics, and discuss possible approaches to predicting whether various cancers will respond to these agents
27990281	bh3 mimetics are designed to inhibit anti-apoptotic bcl2 family proteins, leading to bax and bak activation12–14
27990281	 accordingly, recent advances in understanding the functions of various bcl2 family members provide important insight into the therapeutic effects of bh3 mimetics
27990281	bcl2 family members regulate apoptosis, a distinct form of cell death that plays critical roles in development, immune response, and tissue homeostasis15–17
27990281	 the translocation of these intermembrane proteins is modulated by the bcl2 family of proteins
27990281	based on differences in structure and function, bcl2 family members are divided into three subgroups20–22: bax and bak, which contain three distinct bcl2 homology (bh) domains and, upon activation, permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane (mom) by forming proteinaceous pores23–26 or in other ways27–30
27990281	 and the bh3-only proteins bim, bid, puma, noxa, bad, bik, bmf, and hrk, which share homology with other bcl2 family members only in their 15-amino-acid α-helical bh3 domain and induce apoptosis by facilitating bax and/or bak activation22
27990281	 in this model, the major role of anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members is to inhibit the bh3-only proteins
27990281	 the indirect activation model proposes that bax and bak are tonically activated but are restrained by anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members34
27990281	 in this model, bh3-only proteins induced by various death signals primarily inhibit the anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members, leading to the release of activated bax and bak
27990281	 finally, the unified model proposes that anti-apoptotic bcl2 family proteins inhibit both bh3-only proteins and activated bax or bak35
27990281	 in both instances, the exposed bh3 domains of the pro-apoptotic proteins are neutralized by interaction with bh3-binding grooves, extended clefts on the surfaces of anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members36,37
27990281	neutralization of bh3-binding grooves on anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members is not, by itself, sufficient to kill cells
27990281	 instead, binding of bh3 mimetics to anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members must result in bax and/or bak activation to elicit cell death
27990281	in model 1 (left), bh3 mimetics are thought to displace activated bim from anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members, allowing bim to subsequently activate bax and bak44
27990281	 in model 2 (right), bak and/or bax are constitutively activated and are displaced from anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members by bh3 mimetics46
27990281	 table below figure, summary of bcl2 subfamilies, their functions, and members
27990281	 to the extent that bh3-only proteins are constitutively activated but sequestered by anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members44,45, displacement of bh3-only proteins by bh3 mimetics can provide a driving force for bax and bak activation (figure 1, model 1)
27990281	 based on these observations, bh3 mimetics might be killing cells by displacing partially activated bak from anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members (figure 1, model 2)
27990281	as these complex and highly dynamic interactions between various bcl2 family members were being elucidated, small molecules that could mimic the effects of bh3-only proteins were also being developed
27990281	navitoclax (abt-263), an orally bioavailable small molecule with a binding profile similar to that of abt-7379, also disrupts interactions involving bcl2 and bclxl, causes bax/bak-dependent apoptosis in vitro, and induces complete regressions in xenograft models of small-cell lung cancer (sclc) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all)9
27990281	 this hypersensitivity of cll was thought to reflect frequent deletion of genes on chromosome 13q14 encoding mir15a and mir16a, two micrornas that normally inhibit bcl2 expression53,54
27990281	 loss of these micrornas is thought to result in constitutive bcl2 overexpression and bcl2 addiction5,6,55
27990281	 although this thrombocytopenia could be diminished by treating patients with 150 mg navitoclax/day for one week followed by therapeutic does of 325 mg daily10, maximal bcl2 inhibition was never achieved in lymphoid malignancies because of toxicities of bclxl inhibition in other normal tissues
27990281	developed specifically to avoid the thrombocytopenia associated with bclxl inhibition, venetoclax exhibits selectivity for bcl2 over bclxl (kd <0
27990281	 in this latter disease, bcl2 is highly expressed because of dot1l-mediated h3k79 methylation67, rendering mllr all sensitive to venetoclax alone66,67
27990281	bcl2 has also been implicated in the survival of multiple myeloma (mm) cells, particularly those with t(11
27990281	in most solid tumors, bclxl and mcl1 appear to be more important than bcl2 in inhibiting apoptosis79
27990281	 however, sclc80 and estrogen receptor-positive (er+) breast cancer81 exhibit high bcl2 expression and venetoclax sensitivity
27990281	several groups have reported that chemotherapy sensitivity can be predicted by algorithms that essentially measure levels of anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members, sum the values, and subtract levels of bax and bak105–107
27990281	 myc-transformed murine lymphomas are sensitive to navitoclax only if they have elevated bcl2 levels107
27990281	 accordingly, measurement of bcl2 alone might help predict sensitive versus resistant cll cases
27990281	 consistent with this possibility, recent studies have reported that high bcl2 expression correlates with venetoclax sensitivity in neoplastic lymphocytes11,108
27990281	 because the bad bh3 and hrk bh3 domains have different affinities for anti-apoptotic bcl2 family proteins44,115, with bad binding bcl2 and bclxl tightly but hrk binding only bclxl, subtracting the cytochrome c release caused by hrk from that caused by bad (bad–hrk) reportedly predicts venetoclax sensitivity116
27990281	 there is also a correlation between preformed bcl2·bak complexes and venetoclax sensitivity46, perhaps reflecting the fact that these complexes, though somewhat less stable, nonetheless form when bcl2 is expressed at high levels or harbors gain-of-function mutations118,119
27990281	 all of these complexes between bak and anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members can, like complexes between bh3-only proteins and anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members44,45, be detected and potentially quantified by immunoprecipitation46
27990281	 because anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members are expressed on the cytoplasmic surfaces of multiple organelles, not just mitochondria120,121, it is possible that immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for bak, bax, and bh3-only proteins will provide a more complete picture of the cellular balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic bcl2 family members than mom permeabilization analyses alone

27936237	 pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, such as noxa, bcl2 and mcl1, are involved in the regulation of these apoptotic pathways, and more recently both oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress pathways have also been implicated [14, 18–21]

27936237	 expression analysis of the pro-apoptotic gene bim and anti-apoptotic gene bcl2 over a 72 h treatment period revealed that bcl2 expression was heightened for the treatment duration, while bim remained unchanged (fig 5d)
27936237	 as we previously demonstrated that bcl2 was down regulated and bim up regulated by imiquimod treatment in dftd cells, these results suggest that differential regulation of pro- and anti- apoptotic proteins plays a role in preventing imiquimod-induced apoptosis in tasmanian devil fibroblasts

27805565	delineation of the roles of pro-survival homologs in a given cancer, termed bcl2 profiling, aims to reveal which homolog or homologs a tailored treatment should target to maximize anti-cancer activity and minimize toxicity
27805565	 bcl2 profiling using natural bops, bh3-mimicking peptides or small molecules is complicated by their low specificity (certo et al
27805565	 here we describe the computational design and experimental characterization of specific, high affinity protein inhibitors for all six pro-survival bcl2 homologs (figure 1—figure supplement 1)
27805565	 this comprehensive set of molecular probes should be useful to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, determine bcl2 profiles of individual cancers, and provide a superior guide for tailored therapies
27805565	we recently described a de novo designed protein inhibitor of bhrf1, an epstein-barr viral bcl2 homolog
27805565	 pro-survival bcl2 homologs share similar sequences (40–60% similarity between any two) and structures (approximately 3 Å rmsd), and hence achieving specific binding for each one is a challenging problem
27805565	 we hypothesized that the expanded binding interface of the bindi scaffold could enable design of specificity by contacting regions where bcl2 homolog sequences differ both within and outside of the conserved bh3 binding cleft (figure 2)
27805565	 side chain rotamers of the target bcl2 homolog were allowed to sample alternative conformations compatible with the redesigned interface
27805565	 figure 2—figure supplement 1f) to qualitatively assess affinity and specificity for the target bcl2 protein
27805565	initial bcl-w-targeting designs, however, did not bind bcl-w or any other bcl2 protein, likely because the designs were based on the crystal structure of bcl-w bound to a ligand that is not bh3-like (pdb 4k5a), unlike successful designs that were based on bh3-liganded structures (supplementary file 1a)
27805565	 the yeast library was sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) for binding to biotinylated bcl-w in the presence of the other bcl2 pro-survival homologs as unlabeled competitors
27805565	the computational design calculations succeeded in generating proteins that bound to each of the six human bcl2 homologs with nanomolar affinity and at least partial specificity
27805565	 (c) conservation scores from a sequence alignment of bcl2 proteins are mapped to bhrf1 (surface) bound to bindi (gray ribbon)
27805565	010to improve the affinity and specificity of the designed inhibitors targeting other bcl2 homologs, the genes for 2-cdp06, x-cdp07, w-cdp03, f-cdp01 and b-cdp01 were diversified by site-directed saturation mutagenesis (ssm)
27805565	012(a) ssm libraries were generated based on the indicated cdps and sorted for high affinity and specificity to each target bcl2 homolog
27805565	 (c) an ssm library was generated based on the partially-specific mcl-1-targeting design m-cdp02 (see figure 2—figure supplement 1f) and sorted for high affinity and specificity to each indicated bcl2 homolog
27805565	013cdps were computationally docked into the canonical binding groove of each pro-survival bcl2 homolog, sampling both local (close to the input bound conformation) and global (entire protein surface) environments
27805565	014optimized, specific inhibitors were computationally docked into the canonical binding groove of each pro-survival bcl2 homolog, sampling both local (close to the input bound conformation) and global (entire protein surface) environments
27805565	015to experimentally evaluate the contribution of computational design, we carried out control evolution experiments starting from a single, partially-specific mcl-1-targeting design aiming for specificity toward each of the other pro-survival bcl2 proteins
27805565	 mutations that enhance the affinity of m-cdp02 for bcl2 members other than mcl-1 include prolines in the first and third helical segments, substitutions of apolar to polar amino acids in the hydrophobic core, and premature stop codons in the third helix
27805565	 in contrast, none of these destabilizing mutations were enriched during the evolution of the individual computational designs explicitly targeting each bcl2 homolog
27805565	 each cdp and optimized inhibitor was docked into the canonical binding groove of each bcl2 homolog, and thousands of docked configurations were sampled both locally (low rmsd to input configuration) and globally (entire protein surface)
27805565	 the sequence variability of the designed proteins complements that of the bcl2 proteins across the interface, indicating that the designed proteins gain specificity by taking advantage of regions where bcl2 homologs differ (figure 4b–c)
27805565	many mutations at the interface periphery change surface electrostatic potential to improve charge complementarity with the target or oppose interactions with off-target bcl2 proteins
27805565	we investigated the bcl2 binding profiles and mechanism of action of the optimized inhibitors in mammalian cells, employing a suite of engineered mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs)
27805565	 we tested whether our inhibitors could selectively induce a hallmark of apoptosis by monitoring cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol of mefs with engineered dependence on a single pro-survival bcl2 homolog
27805565	 strikingly, permeabilized mefs treated with each designed inhibitor induced cytochrome c release only in the cell line dependent on the corresponding target bcl2 protein
27805565	(a) western blot for cytochrome c in pelleted (p) and soluble (s) fractions of engineered mefs after permeabilization and treatment with 10 mm bcl2 inhibitors
27805565	 (b) long-term survival assays for engineered mefs with indicated bcl2 dependency, after inducing expression of αmcl1 or αbfl1
27805565	 these data validate the specificity of the designed proteins and their capacity to functionally engage bcl2 family members in a cellular milieu
27805565	while engineered mefs provided an excellent model system to study our designed proteins, we sought further mechanistic validation in a context relevant to their primary application: probing bcl2 family interactions and generating functional bcl2 dependency profiles in cancer
27805565	 thus, increased expression of a given bcl2 protein can compensate for the inhibition of others
27805565	next, we set out to define functional bcl2 dependency profiles of other cancer cell lines using a larger set of our designed inhibitors
27805565	022to more fully assess the capacity of the designed inhibitors to determine bcl2 profiles, we tested them alongside existing, selective bh3-mimetics in a larger number of cell lines from one type of cancer
27805565	this work offers the first complete set of specific inhibitors for each of the six pro-survival bcl2 proteins, including the first reported specific inhibitors for bcl-w and bcl-b
27805565	 for example, the designed proteins can be easily modified for added functionality, such as adding a mitochondrial targeting sequence, or fusing an e3 ligase to each design to catalyze degradation of their target bcl2 proteins
27805565	 the designed protein inhibitors can be genetically encoded, enabling spatial and temporal control of expression, and have distinct advantages over broadly eliminating the target bcl2 protein using crispr- or rnai-mediated knockdown or knockout
27805565	 some bcl2 proteins translocate from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane in response to apoptotic stimuli, and the effect of inhibition in these different compartments can be probed by localizing the designed inhibitors with the appropriate targeting sequences and inducing expression before and after apoptotic stimuli
27805565	as confirmed by biochemical analyses and x-ray crystal structures, the designed proteins engage the bh3-binding grooves of their specific target pro-survival bcl2 family members
27805565	 mrna profiling indicates mcl-1 and bcl-xl are indeed more prevalent than other bcl2 homologs in many colon cancers, but resistant hct-116 is indistinguishable from sensitive lines like caco-2 and ht-29 (placzek et al
27805565	 bcl2 homologs were enzymatically biotinylated in vitro with bira
27805565	 purified designed proteins were screened for binding to bcl2 homologs with bio-layer interferometry
27805565	mef and hela cells were retrovirally infected with constructs for constitutive expression of bcl2 pro-survival homologs and selected with facs (mef) or geneticin (hela)
27805565	'the following crystallographic models of ligand-bound bcl2 homologs, found in the protein data bank, were used to manually graft side chains onto a fixed backbone, as described below: 2pqk (mcl-1•bim-bh3), 3pk1 (mcl-1•bax-bh3), 3kz0 (mcl-1•mb7 peptide), 2xa0 (bcl-2•bax-bh3), 4aq3 (bcl-2•phenylacylsulfonamide), 4ieh (bcl-2•sulfonamide), 4lvt (bcl-2•navitoclax), 1pq1 (bcl-xl•bim-bh3), 2yq6 (bcl-xl•bimsahb), 2yq7 (bcl-xl•bimlock), 3pl7 (bcl-xl•bax-bh3), 4bpk (bcl-xl•α/β-puma-bh3), 4k5a (bcl-w•darpin) 3i1h (bfl-1•bak-bh3), and 4b4s (bcl-b•bim-bh3)
27805565	 the bcl-w sequence was threaded onto structurally analogous positions in existing crystallographic models of other bcl2 homologs
27805565	a suitable helical region of the bindi protein (pdb 4oyd chain b) was aligned to the bh3-motif ligand in crystallographic models of each bcl2 pro-survival homolog, using pymol (schrödinger
27805565	 the structural alignment was visually inspected, and any docked configurations with backbone clashes between the scaffold protein and bcl2 homolog were discarded
27805565	 increased expression of pro-survival bcl2 proteins was confirmed by western blotting using anti-bcl-2 (santa cruz biotechnology, dallas, tx

27805565	 3) if one computationally docks the final engineered proteins against the various family members is it possible to pick out which protein they bind to? to address comments 2 and 3, we have computationally docked each designed protein and optimized variant into the binding grooves of each bcl2 pro-survival homolog (figure 5—figure supplement 2 and 3)
27805565	 we think the schematic is appropriate to include in the introduction, in which we describe the biological significance of bcl2 inter-family interactions and summarize current bh3-mimetic inhibitors
27795807	 furthermore, pretreatment with ns398 (cox-2 specific inhibitor) significantly attenuated h/r-induced cell injury [lower lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) leakage and enhanced cell viability] and apoptosis (higher bcl2 expression and lower level of cleaved caspases-3 and tunel-positive cells) in cardiomyocytes
27795807	 number 2772s), bcl2 (1 : 1000, cat
27795807	 the expression of bax was not affected by h/r stimulation in the current settings of cardiomyocyte h/r model, whereas the expression of bcl2 was significantly decreased and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was drastically enhanced in the h/r group as compared to control cells
27795807	 pretreatment with ns398 significantly reduced expression of cleaved caspase-3 and enhanced bcl2 expression (figure 3(a)), resulting in significant attenuation of h/r induced increases in apoptotic cell death (figure 3(b)) as measured by tunel assay which detects the dna fragmentation, a characteristic feature of cell apoptosis [37]
27665744	 we assigned all the cases a histogenetic profile, based on the immunohistochemical detection of cd10, bcl6, and mum1, and a “double hit score” upon positivity for bcl2 and myc
27665744	 our data confirmed the aggressive behavior of pcdlbc-lt, which often coexpressed myc and bcl2
27665744	 the impact of single factors on 5-year survival was documented, particularly histogenetic profile in pcdlbcl and bcl2 translocation in pcfccl
27788210	 this was accompanied by a more effective g2/m checkpoint, and decreased protein expression of the dna repair gene brca1, and the apoptosis inhibitor bcl2
27788210	 next, we analyzed the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl2 and xiap
27788210	 independent of cisplatin treatment, we found that both protein and mrna levels of bcl2 were significantly lower (fig 4a, 4b and 4c)
27788210	mechanistically, our in vitro data indicated that the improved cisplatin sensitivity by nuclear commd1 is possibly linked to reduced protein expression of the genes brca1, and bcl2
27788210	 in this context, brca1 was demonstrated to regulate the expression of the nf-κb anti-apoptotic target genes bcl2 and xiap, in a fashion dependent on the nf-κb subunit p50 [33]
27788210	 since commd1 inhibits nf-κb activity and can interact with brca1, it is tempting to speculate that nuclear commd1 represses the brca1-p50 mediated transcription of bcl2 and xiap and thereby sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (model in fig 6)
27777645	 in astrocytes, mir expression patterns regulate mitochondrial function in response to oxidative stress via targeting of bcl2 and heat shock protein 70 family members
27777645	two families of well-known cytoprotective proteins, the hsp70 family of chaperones and the bcl2 apoptosis-regulating family, have been shown to be integral to maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis
27777645	 the bcl2 protein family is a central regulator of cell survival by helping to maintain mitochondrial membrane integrity and function and coordinating apoptotic signaling [79, 80]
27777645	the bcl2 family is known to play an important role in the evolution of injury following cerebral ischemia [81]
27777645	 overexpressing prosurvival bcl2 family members protects against cerebral ischemia in vivo [82, 83] and in vitro [84]
27777645	 cytosolic bcl2 was shown to contribute to mam formation by localizing to both the er and the mitochondrial outer membranes [85] and to coordinate er and mitochondrial ca2+ homeostasis following cerebral ischemia [8, 86]
27777645	 in addition to regulating induction of apoptosis by controlling mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, bcl2 protein family members have been shown to regulate calcium handling [87] and modulate intercompartmental cross talk between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum [88, 89]
27777645	hsp72, a cytosolic member of the hsp70 family, participates in protein import and sorting at mam [90] and regulates downstream bcl2 expression [91]
27777645	 overexpression protected hippocampus neurons from global cerebral ischemia, mediated in part by increased bcl2 expression [91]
27777645	 bioinformatics and dual luciferase assays were used to identify and validate mir-181a as a regulator of several hsp70 [117, 118] and bcl2 family members [118]
27777645	 this protective effect, including recovery of motor function and coordination, persisted over 28 days [119], concordant with decreased expression of bcl2 and x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (xiap)
27777645	 interestingly in primary neurons mir-181a failed to significantly alter levels of bcl2 and did not improve survival after ischemia-like injury [120]
27777645	 reported that increasing mir-29b had the effect of promoting neuronal cell death in focal ischemia by inhibiting bcl2l2 (protein bcl-w), an antiapoptotic member of the bcl2 protein family [128]
27777645	org/) predict that mir-29b targets several members of the bcl2 family known to be both protective and harmful
27777645	 the multiple functions of mir-29b are therefore likely due to which bcl2 family member exerts the more dominant effect in a given cell type and in response to a given injury paradigm
27777645	 observed that mir-29a mimic protected and mir-29a inhibitor aggravated astrocyte injury and mitochondrial function by targeting the bcl2 family member p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (puma, [115])
27777645	 puma binds and antagonizes all known antiapoptotic bcl2 family members and activates two key multidomain proapoptotic bcl2 family proteins, bax and bak, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation [130]
27777645	 however, the combinatorial effect of the short binding sequence can also offset any protective effects if the same mir simultaneously binds gene family members with opposite functions, as has been demonstrated with mir-29 and bcl2 family members
27776559	 we then studied the combination of nelarabine with the pi3k inhibitors (both pan and dual γ/δ inhibitors), with the bcl2 specific inhibitor abt199, and with the mek inhibitor trametinib on both t-all cell lines and patient samples at relapse, which displayed constitutive activation of pi3k signaling and resistance to nelarabine alone
27776559	 the drug combination caused akt dephosphorylation and a downregulation of bcl2, while nelarabine alone induced an increase in p-akt and bcl2 signaling in the resistant t-all cells and relapsed patient samples
27776559	 the effects of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) inhibition on fludarabine sensitivity could be related to changes in the expression of bcl2 family proteins (mcl-1 and bim) [23, 24] which are also involved in clofarabine sensitivity in aml cells [22]
27776559	 a recent study underscored a potential role for bcl2 family proteins in determining nelarabine resistance, in an ara-g-resistant t-all cell line variant, established by serial incubation with ara-g (the active metabolite of nelarabine) [27]
27776559	here, we demonstrate that in nelarabine-resistant t-all cell lines, there is a hyperactivation of pi3k/akt/mtor, erk1/2 and bcl2 signaling in response to nelarabine
27776559	 treatment with zstk-474 (a pan pi3k p110 inhibitor [28]), ipi-145 (duvelisib@, a γ/δ pi3k p110 inhibitor [29]), gsk1120212 (trametinib@, a mek inhibitor [30]), or abt199 (venetoclax@, a bcl2 inhibitor [31]) synergized with nelarabine in reducing cell survival in nelarabine-resistant t-all cells
27776559	 moreover, nelarabine combined with zstk-474 induced a dephosphorylation of akt and erk1/2 and induced an increase in the expression of bax and bak pro-apoptotic members of bcl2 family in t-all cells resistant to nelarabine
27776559	 molecular weights are indicated on the rightnelarabine resistance does not depend on expression of ent1/2 transporters and is partly due to upregulation of pi3k, mek, and bcl2 signaling

27776559	 the amount of protein was normalized to β-actin density and expressed as fold change compared to control (ratio = bcl2 treated/bcl2 control)
27776559	 results showed a significant increase in the bcl2 protein expression only in peer cell line, at 48-h treatment, p < 0
27776559	 the histograms are representative of two separate experimentsa recent study underscored a potential role for bcl2 family members in determining nelarabine resistance, as a nelarabine-resistant t-all cell line displayed increased anti-apoptotic bcl-xl levels, whereas pro-apoptotic bax and bad levels were decreased [27]
27776559	 to better understand the role of bcl2 family, it was first investigated the gene expression of bcl2 and bcl-xl genes in sensitive and resistant to nelarabine cell lines
27776559	 by western blotting, we analyzed the effects of nelarabine on the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl2 and bcl-xl proteins in resistant cell lines
27776559	 among t-all cell lines, loucy cell line showed the highest level of expression of bcl2 under basal conditions (additional file 3: figure s3)
27776559	 nelarabine treatment affected the expression of bcl2 in all resistant cell lines analyzed

27776559	 loucy cells are representative of etp-all and displayed the highest bcl2 expression and sensitiveness to bcl2 inhibition by abt199 [43]
27776559	 furthermore, the combination of nelarabine with zstk-474 was able to induce a decrease in the bcl2 and bcl-xl protein expression in all cell lines resistant to nelarabine alone, except for loucy cells, which were not affected by the combined treatment (fig

27729033	 besides, we found rapid up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes including c-myc, fadd, bax and, while down-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene bcl2 which eventually led to the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 cascade, suggesting that cps-induced apoptosis might partly occured through a mitochondrion-mediated pathway
27729033	 the ratio of bcl2 to bax, rather than the levels of the individual proteins, is considered to be critical in determining the survival or death of cells [33]
27729033	 we showed that bcl2 was decreased while bax increased thus the ratio of bcl2 and bax decreased dramatically by cps, which may induce apoptotic response
27729033	 these events were associated with substantial up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes including c-myc, fadd, bax and cleaved-caspase-3, -8, and -9, while down-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene bcl2
27723829	 gene expression levels of other pro- or anti-apoptic genes in the bcl2 family in mda-mb-231br relative to those in mda-mb-231 were marginal
27723829	, disruption of intracellular bcl2 family protein-protein interactions, abt-263 did not affect either cox-2/bcl2a1 mrna or protein expressions in mda-mb-231br (s5 fig)
27723829	a member of the bcl2 family, bcl2a1 is known to contribute to drug resistance [8, 16–18] through a reduction in the release of pro-apoptotic cytochrome c from mitochondria and the inhibition of caspase activation [18]
27723829	it has been widely accepted that nf-κb is an important transcription factor of the apoptosis regulator bcl2 family [17] (fig 10), which was the rationale behind the use of an nf-κb inhibitor bay11-7082 in this study to inhibit the expressions of bcl2a1 mrna/protein

27688871	 erβa and e2 pre-treatment led to a significant reduction in apoptosis with decreased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and increased mitochondrial levels of anti-apoptotic bcl2 and acaa2
27688871	 antibodies against cytochrome c (cytochrome c releasing apoptosis assay kit (#ab65311, abcam), bcl2 (#ab692, abcam), acetylcoenzyme a acyltransferase 2 (acaa2) (#sc-100847, santa cruz biotechnology), tim23 (#611222 bd biosciences), mitoprofile® total oxphos rodent wb antibody cocktail (#ab110413, abcam), myosin light chain 2 (mlc2) (#ab92721, abcam), myosin light chain (pmlc2) (#ab2480, abcam), phospho-p44/42 mapk (erk1/2) (#4370, cell signaling), and p44/42 mapk (erk1/2) (137f5) (#4695, cell signaling) had been used
27688871	 relative protein expression data for measurement of bcl2 (c) and acaa2 (d) in mitochondrial fractions as well as total caspase 9 (e) and cleavage product (f) in whole cell lysate, data are shown mean ± sem
27688871	 in particular, we found that both erβa and e2 increased the amount of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl2 in the mitochondria
27688871	 physiological relevance of our recent finding is supported by previous studies showing that increased bcl2 levels are associated with reduced apoptosis, reduced infarct size, and improved recovery of cardiac function after i/r [29, 30]
27688871	 moreover, expression of bcl2 is controlled by erβ
27688871	 bcl2 family proteins, located in mitochondrial membranes, provide protection against pro-apoptotic stimuli [17]
27688871	 bcl2 prevents permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane [31] and thereby prevents the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria
27688871	 acaa2 is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in lipid metabolism that was identified as a binding partner for the pro-apoptotic protein bcl2 and 19-kda interacting protein-3 (bnip3) [23, 34]
27687594	 finally, we suggest that autophagy associated with doxorubicin resistance may be distinct from classical starvation-induced autophagy, since beclin 1 and atg7 expression did not change upon acquisition of doxorubicin resistance, nor did recombinant bcl2 overexpression or an atg7 knockdown alter doxorubicin cytotoxicity
27687594	 the ultimate fate of cells under stress depends upon the net effect of apoptotic versus survival signals, often regulated by important cellular regulatory proteins such as bcl2 and p53 [12, 13]
27682256	 the expression kinetics of bax and bcl2 genes strongly indicate the occurrence of heat stress induced apoptosis in the buffalo mecs
27682256	 several studies have suggested that pro-apoptotic genes like bax accelerates programmed cell death by binding to, and antagonizing the apoptosis repressor bcl2 gene
27682256	 on the other hand, bcl2 gene prevents the opening of ptp and also encodes an integral outer mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks the apoptotic death
27682256	 the observed expression profile of bax and bcl2 genes strongly suggests that heat stress induces cell apoptosis by triggering perturbation of mitochondrial function
27677077	 finally, rs3744935 in bcl2 was associated with cc in the allele and codominant models

27670300	 three antibodies were analyzed: ki67, bcl2 and hsp70
27670300	 the bcl2 antibody (novocastra laboratories ltd, 1:200 dilution) recognizes a mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks programmed cell death, and thus acts as an anti-apoptotic index
27670300	 a microphotography shows bcl2 staining in fresh stromal cells, compared to cryopreservation tissue in pp (b) and quartz (c)
27670300	 for follicles a positive bcl2 staining was found in gcs after cryopreservation in pp (d) and quartz (e)

27670300	diffuse positivity for bcl2 in gcs, stromal cells, and vessels observed after cryopreservation in both devices confirmed that these cells are not in a state of apoptosis

27669008	 bcl2 upregulation was specific to gmps
27669008	 some patients had bcl2 overexpression in cd34+ ros-high as well as ros-low fractions which may be indicative of poor early response to standard chemotherapy
27669008	 thus normal spc subsets have distinct ros, cell-cycle, bcl2 profiles that in aml /mds-raeb are decoupled from maturation
27669008	  (2016) normal hematopoietic progenitor subsets have distinct reactive oxygen species, bcl2 and cell-cycle profiles that are decoupled from maturation in acute myeloid leukemia
27669008	 these and other mechanisms for bcl2 dependence suggest that chemo-resistant aml lsc may be targeted by the novel bcl2 inhibitor abt199 /venetoclax [24,25]
27669008	 potentially, low intracellular ros levels could be used as a differential functional marker of chemo-resistant leukemic stem/progenitor cells (spc) within immunophenotypic subsets pre- and post-treatment, particularly if combined with quiescence and bcl2 expression
27669008	 in addition the relationship between ros, bcl2 and cell-cycle status for the different normal and leukemic spc subsets requires further clarification in order to understand the relationship between emergence of spcs with potential chemo-resistant functional properties and maturation stage in both cd34+ and more mature cd34− aml subtypes
27669008	 we sought to investigate this, developing a novel combined flow cytometry assay to measure ros, cell-cycle (ki67) and the anti-apoptotic marker bcl2 in blast populations from normal, mds and aml patients
27669008	although ros, bcl2 expression and cell-cycle status have previously been functionally linked [2,23,33,34] there are as yet no data assessing these therapeutically relevant parameters in parallel for normal or leukemic spc subsets
27669008	 in control bms cd34+cd38high cells expressed higher levels of both ki67 and bcl2 than cd34+cd38low cells (example in fig 5a)
27669008	 closer inspection (in 11 cases) showed that although there was no significant difference in ki67 between cmp, gmp and mep subsets, bcl2 expression followed a gmp>cmp>mep hierarchy (s3a and s3b fig) as observed for ros levels
27669008	 within the more immature cd34+cd38low fraction, all the subsets had low bcl2 but lmpp had high ki67 expression unlike the quiescent hsc/mpp populations (s3a and s3b fig)
27669008	 cd34− cells (mixed myeloid/erythroid) in controls were as proliferative as cd34+cd38high spcs but had low bcl2 at levels similar to cd34+cd38low spcs and mep (fig 6a and 6b)
27669008	 the observed bcl2 upregulation in the gmp subset suggests that at this myeloid maturation stage when higher ros levels prime for proliferation/maturation, bcl2 might be transiently expressed for protection against further oxidative stress
27669008	plots show representative immunophenotypic blasts stained with dcf, ki67 and bcl2 in control bm (a) cd34+aml bm (b) and cd34− aml bm (c)
27669008	g005cd34+cd38low, cd34+cd38high and cd34− (cd117+) blast subsets were compared for ki67-positivity (a), bcl2 expression (using bcl2-specific mfi defined by fold increase over staining with appropriate fluorescent isotype-control mab) and the aberrant ki67lowbcl2high phenotype (c), which is defined using isotype control staining (see s3e fig)
27669008	g006in cd34+ aml diagnosis samples (n = 29), a range of ki67 and bcl2 staining was observed across cd34+cd38low, cd34+cd38high and cd34− blast subsets
27669008	 overall, however, the blasts were less proliferative (ki67low) and, in some cases, over-expressed bcl2 compared to respective control subsets (fig 6a–6c, s3c and s3d fig)
27669008	 bcl2 expression was particularly high (compared to control spc) in the lmpp-like (cd34+cd38low) populations of several lmpp/gmp-like amls as well as ki67low including all the flt3itd+/npm1wt patients (s3c and s3d fig)
27669008	 cd34−amls (n = 11) were also significantly less proliferative and higher for bcl2 than control cd34− cd117+ cells (fig 5c)
27669008	we hypothesised that bcl2 over-expression (with downstream effects on apoptosis, metabolic regulation and cell-cycle) might be maintained in ros-high blasts of some amls to counteract further oxidative stress similar to the observed bcl2 upregulation at the gm maturation stage
27669008	 similar ki67 and bcl2 levels were, however, maintained between roslowest and roshighest blasts in a number of aml/mds-raeb patients
27669008	 from available clinical data of early post-treatment outcome for cd34+ amls, high bcl2 over-expression (>6
27669008	 a correlation between bcl2 overexpression in roslowest/roshighest and early treatment response was not apparent in cd34− amls including the flt3itd+/npm1mutated patients (fig 7e)
27669008	aml progenitors stained with mab for surface markers, dcf, ki67 and bcl2 were separated into roslowest and roshighest cells based on the 20% dimmest and 20% brightest dcf staining populations respectively
27669008	 charts show ki67 and bcl2 expression respectively in roslowest and roshighest subsets in (a-b) cd34+ amls, (c-d) in cd34− amls and (e-f) in cd34+ cells in mds patients with no excess blasts (no eb) and mds patients with excess blasts (raeb-1/raeb-2)
27669008	 thresholds for high bcl2 expression are shown as dashed lines on each bcl2 chart
27669008	 high levels of abt199 sensitivity (ec50 at or below 100nm) was observed in both cd34+ and cd34− amls, irrespective of differences in intracellular ros, bcl2 and cell-cycle status
27669008	 normal human cd34+ and cd34−cd117+ spc subsets exhibit distinct patterns of ros, cell-cycle activity with bcl2 expression upregulation at the gm stage
27669008	 extending our analysis by evaluation of the combined ros/cell-cycle/bcl2 profile showed that all subsets (gmp/cmp/mep) of cd34+cd38high cells had high levels of cell-cycle activity despite variation in ros levels but bcl2 upregulation correlated with increasing ros levels and was thus myeloid-specific
27669008	 bcl2 protein upregulation may be a survival cue to counteract oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in gmps when higher ros levels are required to prime for proliferation/maturation
27669008	 reduced ki67 expression, high bcl2 expression and most significantly an expanded ki67lowbcl2high phenotype were observed in aml and mds-raeb but not mds-noeb
27669008	 the in vivo lsc frequency of identified ki67lowbcl2highcells could not be investigated by xenografting experiments due non-viability following intracellular staining but ki67 and bcl2 expression, either as single parameters or when combined as ki67lowbcl2high, did not correlate with early outcome to standard treatment in our small patient group
27669008	 this is not unexpected as chemo-resistance is also dependent on the balance between activities of different pro-/anti-apoptotic bcl2 family proteins [47–49] as well as drug efflux activity [50]
27669008	 further sub-analysis of roshighest and roslowest cells within the blast population of each patient showed that, although aberrant bcl2 overexpression has been reported as an adaptation of lsc-enriched roslowest aml cells [2], roshighest cells were also bcl2high for some cd34+ amls (8/24) and cd34− amls (7/9)
27669008	 intriguingly, aberrant overexpression of bcl2 in roshighest as well as roslowest blasts was the profile most associated with early chemotherapy resistance from limited available data in the 24 cd34+ amls with outcome data
27669008	 however, sensitivity to bcl2 inhibition in vitro using abt199 in a small number of tested patients was high across both cd34+ and cd34- aml blast types with different ros, ki67 and bcl2 levels
27669008	 thus bcl2 dependence was shared by phenotypically different aml blasts
27669008	it may also be postulated from our results that bcl2 over-expression (with downstream effects on apoptosis, metabolic regulation and cell-cycle) is an adapted ‘gm-like’ property (to intrinsic or extrinsic dysregulation) that in some amls modulates the apoptotic threshold to additional oxidative stress as well as metabolic adjustments

27551266	 members of the bcl2 family proteins play a major role in governing this mitochondrial dependent pathway
27551266	 bcl2 family proteins have been grouped into three classes (youle and strasser, 2008)

27529753	 additionally, the relationship between bax and bcl2 was demonstrated at the gene level in this in vitro study
27529753	 our results revealed that c1 controls the mmp via the up regulation of bax and bad, and the down regulation of bcl2 in addition to the control of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol, which then triggers caspase 9

27433938	 the purpose of this study was to explore the effect of the t-cell overexpression of bcl2a1, an anti-apoptotic bcl2 family member without an effect on cell cycle progression, in the development of collagen-induced arthritis
27433938	 thus, mice and humans with mutations in fas/fasl, transgenic (tg) mice overexpressing human bcl2 (hbcl2) in b lymphocytes or mice with a targeted disruption of bim, a pro-apoptotic bcl2 relative, develop an autoimmune syndrome resembling systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) in association or not with lymphoproliferation [1–5]
27433938	 in both studies, the protective effect was associated with a defective t-cell activation, that was manifested by a reduced activation of phospholipase c (plc)γ1 [11] or by the inhibition of bcl2 interaction with inositol triphosphate receptor resulting in an impaired activation of nuclear factor of activated t-cells (nfat), but not of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) or nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-κb) [10]
27433938	 to further explore this problem, we study here the effects in the development of autoimmunity of the t-cell overexpression of bcl2a1 (also termed a1 or bfl-1), another prosurvival member of the bcl2 family that together with mcl1 belongs to a different phylogenetic group than bcl2 and bclxl [6, 14]
27433938	 unlike bcl2 and bclxl, bcl2a1 does not retard the cell cycle progression of t cells and does not affect cellular proliferation [15, 16]
27433938	 also, while the hydrophobic region at the c-terminal end of bcl2 and bclxl targets them to cellular membranes [17, 18], bcl2a1 can be found at different locations including mitochondria and cytoplasm [19]
27433938	 the reason for the discrepancy in the mechanism of cia protection between both strains of tg mice was not explained by differences in the capability of bcl2a1 and bcl2 to inhibit several forms of t-cell death
27433938	 however, the death of lymph node cd4+ cells induced after anti-cd3/cd28 activation was not affected by bcl2a1 or bcl2 overexpression (fig 2c
27433938	(a) overexpression of bcl2 or bcl2a1 increases thymocyte viability in vitro
27433938	 (b) overexpression of bcl2 or bcl2a1 blocks thymocyte dexamethasone-induced cell death in vivo
27433938	 in contrast, the effects of inhibiting the intrinsic cell death pathway by the altered expression of bcl2 family members are clearly cellular dependent
27433938	 however, it should be remarked that aicd induction in peripheral cd4+ cells was not affected by bcl2 or bcl2a1 overexpression that otherwise efficiently inhibited other forms of t-cell death
27433938	 these observations suggested that the cell death inhibitory activities of bcl2 and bcla1 were not responsible for the protection against cia development observed in both strains of tg mice
27433938	 instead, the present and previous studies were compatible with a model in which disease protection could be mechanistically linked with the role that each particular bcl2 family member might play in the regulation of cd4+ cell activation and/or functional differentiation
27433938	 while the protection against autoimmune diseases in mice overexpressing bcl2 in t cells was secondary to the capacity of this anti-apoptotic molecule to control the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 that in turn, regulated the differentiation and activity of tregs [12], the protection observed in young, but not old, bim-/- [5, 10, 11] and in bcl2a1 tgt mice was associated with defects in the activation of t cells
27418932	 when cocultured with huc-mscs, t lymphocyte expression of caspase 3 was significantly increased, while bcl2 and cdk4 mrna expression decreased dramatically
27418932	 in addition, the changes in caspase 3, cdk4, and bcl2 expression were reversed by 1-mt
27418932	the expression of bcl2 and caspase 3 in t lymphocytes was detected by qrt–pcr to explore the mechanism of apoptosis caused by msc
27418932	 as expected, huc-mscs significantly inhibited mrna expression of bcl2 and promoted the expression of caspase 3 (figure 5)
27418932	 the addition of 1-mt effectively reversed the changes in bcl2 and caspase 3 expression induced by the huc-mscs
27418435	 the expression levels of tgf-β, bfgf, vegf, pdgf, and bcl2 are simultaneously reduced, and the phosphorylation levels of ampk and acc, as well as the expression level of bax, are increased
27418435	 additionally, fss stimulation decreased the expression of bcl2 and increased the expression of bax (p < 0
27418435	to assess the impact of the apn pre-treatment on signaling pathways activated in fss-cultured rat bmscs, the expression and activity of ampk signaling and the expression of the bcl2 protein family were compared between the groups
27418435	 additionally, apn pre-treatment increased the expression of bcl2 and decreased the expression of bax (p < 0
27418435	 bcl2 and bax have been demonstrated to function as an apoptotic activator and apoptotic inhibitor, respectively
27418435	 our results demonstrated that the activation of ampk by apn can reverse the increased apoptosis of bmscs by the upregulation of bcl2 and downregulation of bax
27418435	 additionally, the protective effects of apn are attributed to the activation of ampk, which can further promote acc phosphorylation, bcl2 up-regulation, and bax down-regulation

27416945	consistent with prior genetic explorations of insulin sensitivity (10), the association of variants at the bcl2 and fam19a2 loci became stronger and genome-wide significant after accounting for the effect of bmi on isi
27416945	the existing literature bolsters our finding of bcl2 as a novel candidate insulin sensitivity locus
27416945	 all these findings suggest that the metabolically deleterious effects of the bcl2 locus become more evident after adjusting for bmi
27416945	 the ability of the isi to detect a genome-wide significant finding in a smaller sample suggests that the bcl2 locus may have a greater influence on insulin sensitivity when fasting and postprandial phenotypes are assessed together
27416945	the mechanism by which bcl2 influences insulin sensitivity remains unclear
27416945	 the bcl2 family of proteins regulate apoptosis through control of mitochondrial permeability (22)
27416945	 mouse models suggest that inhibiting bcl2 improves glucose tolerance through effects on pancreatic β-cells (23)
27416945	 conversely, pharmacological inhibition of the bcl2 protein causes hyperglycemia among a subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (24), but the mechanism of this observation is unknown
27416945	 while bcl2 and fam19a2 are the closest genes to rs12454712 and rs10506418, respectively, we have not excluded other genes in the region (supplementary figs
27416945	 additional in silico findings at the bcl2 and fam19a2 variants are provided in supplementary table 5
27416945	 third, conditional analyses could not be performed in model 3, which would have been the best method of assessing the dependence of the signals at bcl2 and fam19a2
27416945	 however, the ld for each variant with other known glucose and insulin loci in the region was low, and the nominally significant associations of the bcl2 and fam19a2 variants with isi were stable after conditioning in model 2, suggesting that analyses in model 3 would have probably confirmed secondary loci
27416945	 our results demonstrate that the isi is a robust measure of fasting and whole-body measures of insulin sensitivity and suggest that genetic variation in the fam19a2 and bcl2 loci influence insulin sensitivity

27390596	 in addition, patients with myc, bcl2 and bcl6 expression negative or low mvd in tumor tissue with high expression of sparc in stromal cells could have better prognosis than other gastric b-cell lymphomas regardless of their clinical stage and pathological types
27390596	 the most used term to refer to dlbcl is the “double-hit” lymphomas in recent years, with c-myc and bcl2 and/or bcl6 rearrangements identified based on cytogenetic testing [11]
27390596	 also, there is growing interest in the more common “double-protein” lymphomas, which is defined as co-expression of two oncogenes (myc and bcl2 and/or bcl6) on more than a specified proportion of tumor cells based on immunohistochemical staining [11,12]
27390596	 how do the “double-hit” and “double-protein” relate to the patients with primary gastric b-cell lymphomas? there are few reports about the combination of abnormalities of myc and bcl2 or bcl6 in gastric b-cell lymphomas [1-3]

27390596	 only bcl2 expressions in different histological types were statistically significant
27390596	 the negative myc, bcl2 and bcl6 (myc-bcl2-bcl6-) phenotype (n=30) has been associated with a 100% 5-year survival rate, which is significantly different from other phenotypes in any above described pathological types (fig

27390596	 the expression of myc and bcl2 or bcl6 (double-protein expression) was associated with low overall survival (os, poor prognosis) in patients with gastric b-cell lymphomas
27390596	 as to the expression of myc, bcl2 and bcl6, bcl2 expression was statistically significant, while neither myc nor bcl6 expression had significant difference among different histological types of gastric b-cell lymphomas
27390596	 but when comparing the expression of myc, bcl2 and bcl6 with clinical data and following-up data, we can conclude that the co-expression of myc and bcl-2 or bcl-6 were significantly associated with poor outcome in clinical setting and os
27390596	 as we know, myc (c-myc) expression is related to more aggressive lymphomas, in this retrospective study, most patients with “double-protein” of myc and bcl2 or bcl6 co-expression were associated with poor prognosis and with the diagnosis as dlbcl or dlbcl with malt features
27390596	 combining the multivariable analysis, our biologic prognostic model could be used in conjunction of the mvd with sparc, and a serial biomarkers including myc, bcl2 and bcl6 for stratifying management of patients with gastric b-cell lymphomas in clinical risk-adapted therapies in the future [26,29]
27390596	in summary, the “double-hit” is rare among primary gastric b-cell lymphomas, while patients with multiple gene amplification and/or copy gains of c-myc, bcl2 and bcl6, and “double-protein” in gastric b-cell lymphomas were relatively common, which had a poor clinical outcome

27311010	 we further demonstrated that propofol pretreatment attenuated or inhibited the effects caused by tg, such as upregulation of bax, bip, c/ebp homologous protein (chop), active caspase 12, and cleaved caspase 3, and downregulation of bcl2

27303042	 we reveal that bcl2 overexpression can partially, but not entirely, rescue b-cell development in the absence of fnip1, and we provide evidence                               that fnip1 is an endogenous negative regulator of ampk
27303042	 we cannot yet explain how fnip1 deficiency causes a block in b-cell development: overexpression of bcl2 can provide partial rescue, and although autophagy is increased, its inhibition—via temporal deletion of the core autophagy                               protein atg3—fails to rescue the phenotype

27299564	 in our previous study [5] we showed that daily ppag administration (same dose as in the present study) does not affect the following parameters in mice: glycemia, plasma insulin, body weight, food and fluid intake, beta cell mass, proliferation and apoptosis, and bcl2 expression
27299564	the beta-cytoprotective effect was accompanied by the preservation of a normal expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl2 in pancreatic islets in vivo
27299564	 we previously reported that ppag-treated beta cells maintain a higher level of bcl2 expression in conditions of chronic lipotoxicity and er stress-induced apoptosis [5]
27299564	 apoptosis, as a result of decreased bcl2 expression and caspase activation, was the prevalent mode of cell death in stz-injured cells exposed to high glucose
27299564	 under this condition, ppag did not affect bcl2 expression or caspase activation, but it was also beta cell protective
27299564	 our previous work demonstrated that, under lipotoxic conditions, ppag protected against er stress-induced beta cell apoptosis by protecting the anti-apoptotic protein bcl2 from degradation whereas it did not affect expression and activation of pro-apoptotic proteins [5]

27286976	 myc and bcl2 expression had no independent prognostic implication by multivariate analysis in overall patients with pcns-dlbcl
27286976	 however, among patients treated with combined high-dose methotrexate, vincristine and procarbazine and radiotherapy, dual myc and bcl2 overexpression (a cutoff score of 60) was an independent poor prognostic indicator (p = 0
27286976	evaluation of myc and bcl2 expression may be helpful for the determination of pcns-dlbcl prognosis
27286976	recent studies have shown that concomitant myc and bcl2 expression predicts inferior survival in systemic dlbcl patients treated with rituximab-chop [6, 7]
27286976	 moreover, coexpression myc and bcl2 was found to have prognostic value in patients with dlbcl independent of cell of origin, but is related to a high-risk gene expression signature [7]
27286976	 thus, myc and bcl2 coexpression status is very helpful for risk stratification along with the international prognostic index (ipi) score in systemic dlbcl [6, 7]
27286976	 meanwhile, only a few studies are available on myc and bcl2 expression in pcns-dlbcl [8–10]
27286976	 however, these studies have demonstrated conflicting results in terms of prognostic significance of myc and bcl2 status in patients with pcns-dlbcl
27286976	 a study on 47 patients with pcns-dlbcl showed that myc, bcl2 and bcl6 were frequently coexpressed but had no prognostic significance [8]
27286976	 another study demonstrated that myc expression, with or without bcl2 coexpression, was not predictive of clinical outcome in 59 patients with pcns-dlbcl [9]
27286976	 thus, we comprehensively investigated the expression of myc, bcl2 and bcl6, and their association with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in a large cohort of pcns-dlbcl patients

27286976	the rate of bcl2 expression in pcns-dlbcl varies, which might also be attributable to the use of different antibodies and different cutoff values for determining overexpression [8, 9, 16–19]
27286976	 previous studies reported a wide range of bcl2 expression rates (56–92 %) with various cutoff scores from 25–70
27286976	 in their study, bcl2 positivity was observed in 71 % of pcns-dlbcl cases, but had no relationship with prognosis [10]
27286976	 in contrast, the present study demonstrated that patients with pcns-dlbcl and bcl2 overexpression tended to have a shorter pfs and had significantly poorer os, suggesting that bcl2 may potentially be used as a prognostic marker
27286976	in this study, myc and bcl2 expression lost their prognostic significance after multivariate analysis
27286976	 this may be partly attributable to the fact that myc and bcl2 expression was significantly associated with higher mskcc class
27286976	 the myc and bcl2 coexpression rate was 15
27286976	 in this study, patients with pcns-dlbcl and concomitant myc and bcl2 overexpression showed poor pfs (p = 0
27286976	041), and those lacking both myc and bcl2 overexpression had a prolonged os (p = 0
27286976	 however, the statistical significance of myc and bcl2 dual-positivity on the pfs of patients was diminished compared to myc positivity alone (p = 0
27286976	 reported that high myc expression was associated with a lower os, but that concurrent expression of myc and bcl2 showed a tendency towards a lower os with no statistical significance [10]
27286976	 however, in this study, when analyzed in patients with pcns-dlbcl treated with combined mvp and radiotherapy, myc and bcl2 dual-positivity was an independent prognostic factor for poor pfs
27286976	 thus, myc and bcl2 coexpression in pcns-dlbcl seems to have prognostic value, although it is limited compared with systemic dlbcl
27286976	 however, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the largest performed on the expression of myc, bcl2 and bcl6 pcns-dlbcl with long-term follow up, and the first report on the relationship of these factors to clinicopathological features in asian patients

27244080	to investigate the possible interaction between mir-139-5p and bcl2, mutations were introduced into the putative mir-139-5p binding sites in the bcl2 3′-utr, and luciferase reporter constructs generated with the wt and mut 3′-utrs of bcl2 were co-transfected into hct116 and sw620 cells with the mir-139-5p mimics or mir-control vectors
27244080	 luciferase assays showed that ectopic expression of mir-139-5p significantly decreased the luciferase activity of the wt but not that of the mut bcl2 3′-utr in both cell lines (fig
27244080	 we further validated the association between mir-139-5p and bcl2 expression levels in 66 colorectal cancer specimens and found high expression of mir-139-5p was always associated with low bcl2 expression

27244080	 mir-139-5p ko mice exhibited stronger bcl2 staining than their control

27244080	 we then demonstrated that mir-139-5p inhibits emt and enhances the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells by regulating bcl2 expression in vitro
27244080	 in colorectal cancer samples and mir-139-5p mice, the expression levels of mir-139-5p were inversely correlated with bcl2 expression, which suggested that mir-139-5p in colorectal cancer acted as a strong tumour suppressor by regulating the invasiveness and drug resistance
27244080	we identified bcl2 as a direct target of mir-139-5p in colorectal cancer cells and showed that the tumour suppressor activity of mir-139-5p is mediated by the modulation of bcl2 expression
27244080	 bcl2 family proteins regulate and contribute to programmed cell death or apoptosis
27244080	 for example, the bcl2 gene is overexpressed in many solid tumour cell lines, contributing to resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy17
27244080	 furthermore, downregulation of bcl2 sensitizes cells to chemotherapy31
27244080	 bcl2 also serves as a regulator of cancer cell invasion and metastasis32
27244080	 recently, it was reported that bcl2 physically interacts with twist1, which leads to transcriptional regulation of the twist target genes, such as e-cadherin14,15
27244080	 thus, bcl2 may be directly involved in transcriptional regulation of the emt process
27244080	 these results support our current findings and suggest a potential mechanism for the tumour suppressor role of mir-139-5p mediated by the downregulation of bcl2
27244080	in conclusion, the present study showed that mir-139-5p is downregulated in colorectal cancer cells and tissues, and its inhibitory effects on cell migration, invasion, and drug sensitivity are mediated by the downregulation of its target bcl2

27206675	 here we show that the elektra mutation in slfn2 completely prevents a severe lymphoproliferative disease caused by overexpression of bcl2 in combination with fas deficiency in mice
27203692	 the pro-survival bcl2 family proteins (including bcl2, bcl2l1/bcl-xl, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (mcl1), etc
27203692	) interfere with the pro-apoptotic bcl2 family proteins and therefore maintain mitochondrial membrane integrity [40]
27203692	) are also pro-apoptotic, since they interact with pro-survival bcl2 family proteins and prevent them from interfering with bax and bak [39]
27203692	 indeed, the stoichiometry of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic bcl2 family proteins is a main determinant of whether a cell will live or die [30,40]
27203692	 specifically, several bcl2 family genes were androgen-responsive, including the dht-induced pro-apoptotic genes (bcl2l11/bim and bok) and the dht-repressed pro-survival genes (bcl2a1, bcl2l1/bcl-xl, and mcl1) (fig 6a and 6b)
27203692	 immunoblot analysis of bcl2 family gene products demonstrates that the expression of pro-apoptotic bcl2l11/bim is androgen-induced, whereas pro-survival proteins, bcl2l1/bcl-xl and mcl1, are androgen-repressed
27203692	 bcl2 family proteins function as “molecular switches” that fine-tune mitochondrial membrane permeability
27203692	 our study shows that dht up-regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic genes (including bcl2l11/bim and aifm2) and down-regulates the expressions of pro-survival genes (including bcl2l1/bcl-xl and mcl1) indicating that ar signaling may exert its pro-apoptotic activity on mitochondrial membrane permeability by altering the expression of bcl2 family genes
27203692	 notably, the regulation of bcl2 family gene expression is modest, which may explain why dht treatment alone does not induce apoptosis in hpr-1ar
27203692	 however, the multi-target regulation of bcl2 family proteins by ar signaling may sufficiently stress the mitochondria toward a pro-apoptotic state (i
27203692	 the modest changes in the expression of the bcl2 family proteins may explain why dht treatment alone does not induce apoptosis in hpr-1ar cells
27203692	 however, the multi-target regulation of bcl2 family proteins by ar signaling may sufficiently stress the mitochondria towards a pro-apoptotic state (i
27203692	 sts, h2o2, and at101 stimulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by non-selective inhibition of protein kinases [54], oxidative stress and damage [57–59], and suppression of pro-survival bcl2 family genes [55], respectively
27203692	 the net expression changes in the bcl2 family gene products are likely sufficient to increase the probability of hole formation at the mitochondrial surface and therefore lower the threshold for momp
27203692	 the moderate regulation of these bcl2 family genes may be the reason that dht treatment alone fails to induce momp and apoptosis in hpr-1ar
27203692	 further, blockade of ar degradation or overexpression of bcl2 was found to suppress the pro-apoptotic function of ar in lncap-104-r1 [63,64]
27203692	 interestingly, most of these androgen-responsive genes are bcl2 family genes, which are known to regulate mitochondrial membrane permeability, and the expression changes of these genes in response to androgen are consistent with pro-apoptotic ar activity in hpr-1ar
27203692	 hence, the ar-regulated aifm2, apaf1, and bcl2 family genes are putative ar targets
27203547	 we analyzed genes affected by cyp1a1 silencing and found that apoptosis-related bcl2 was significantly down-regulated
27185926	                         given that bcl2 is regulated by both mitf and bptf, we explored whether bptf regulates mitf expression
27185926	 the antiapoptotic bcl2 protein plays important roles in promoting melanocytic survival and as a potential therapeutic target                               (12, 13)
27185926	 the bcl2 gene is a direct target of the mitf protein, because an e-box motif on the bcl2 promoter has been shown to be a principal mechanism by which mitf activates bcl2 (14)
27185926	 our studies suggest the activation of bptf by mitf as an additional mechanism that potentiates bcl2 expression in melanoma                               cells
27185926	 because bcl2 is controlled by both mitf and bptf [and was identified as a bptf-regulated gene (11)], it was important to investigate whether these two genes are involved in activating each other

27178224	 three patients had heterogeneous ctc-er and bcl2 expression indicating incomplete degradation of the er target by fulvestrant
27166267	 in addition, mir-134 induced apoptosis, as indicated by concomitantly with up-regulation of key apoptosis protein cleaved caspase-3, and down-regulation of anti-apoptosis protein bcl2
27160160	 hqh inhibited phosphorylated-akt, phosphorylated- foxo1 and bcl2 expression and upregulated bim, cleaved-caspase-3 and bax expression in a dose-dependent manner, which suggests that hqh induces the apoptosis of all cells via the akt/foxo1 pathway
27148738	during our study of the expression of a bcl2 mrna variant in our ela-mycpt1 mouse pancreatic cancer cell line, we serendipitously obtained a chimeric cdna that was a fusion between the bcl2 and the nek9 genes (fig 7)
27148738	 the bcl2-r2i sequence appears at both ends of the bcl2 partner
27148738	 however, the forward bcl2 primer was not in the cdna, making it unknown how this cdna is formed and amplified
27148738	in this study we cloned eight chimeric cdnas, of which six contain 16s rrna, one contains atp8, and one is a fusion between the bcl2 and the nek9, butall these chimeras cannot be detected using cdna protection assay and thus are likely to be technical artifacts, although currently we still lack technique to futher verify it
27144341	we have undertaken a detailed analysis, in mouse and human thyroid cancer cells, of the mechanism through which obatoclax, a pan-inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic proteins of the bcl2 family, effectively reduces tumor growth in vitro and in vivo
27144341	 strikingly, obatoclax killing activity depends only on its accumulation in the lysosomes, and not on its interaction with bcl2 family members
27135658	 moreover, following transplantation of mscs, bcl2 expression increased, whereas bax expression decreased after reperfusion
27105491	 our data demonstrate that depletion of the rna-binding protein la in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells (hnscc) increases the sensitivity toward cisplatin-induced cell death paralleled by reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic factor bcl2

27101369	 some of them are also hsp90 clients, like gsk3β, cyclin d1, survivin or bcl2 [51,58], so hsp90 inhibition and subsequent akt downregulation are likely to reinforce each other at several points along the akt/nfκb pathway

27099294	 in contrast, the generation of mz b and b1 cells was not                                  rescued, possibly due to a role for canonical nf-κb signaling beyond cell survival (17), consistent with the inability of a bcl2 transgene regulated by vav gene regulatory elements to promote the development of mz b cells in nf-κb1–deficient mice (18)
27099294	 the nemo-deficient b cells overexpressing bcl2                                  exhibited an impaired proliferative response to various mitogenic stimuli in vitro compared with control b cells overexpressing                                  bcl2 (fig
27099294	                               overall, the present results suggest that the main function of canonical nf-κb signaling in follicular b-cell homeostasis                                  is indeed the control of cell survival, as demonstrated by the ability of a bcl2 transgene to rescue a substantial compartment of these cells even under conditions where the ablation of canonical signaling                                  in the b-cell lineage leads to a severe developmental block at the transitional b-cell stage (8, 9)
27099294	 these data are in line with earlier work showing the accumulation of mature b cells in mice reconstituted with rela and                                  c-rel double-deficient fetal liver cells overexpressing bcl2 (14)
27099294	 thus, mz b-cell numbers were strongly reduced in nemofl and ikk2fl cd21-cre+ mice, and the ectopic expression of bcl2 failed to rescue the generation and/or maintenance of nemo-deficient mz b and b1                               cells
27099294	 indeed, similar to the behavior of follicular b cells in the absence of canonical nf-κb signals, ectopic expression of                               bcl2 rescues the generation of follicular b cells in x-linked immunodeficiency (xid) mice, which bear a mutation in btk, and cd23+ transitional and follicular xid b cells are outcompeted by wt b cells (26, 27)

27008505	 upon rbp2 knockdown, bcl2 promoter activity was significantly decreased (fig 4c)

27008505	 these findings suggested that rbp2 overexpression played a critical role in the development and progression of adult all by targeting bcl2
27008505	bcl2 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in both leukemia [26, 27] and solid tumors [28]
27008505	 as a breakthrough finding, our experiments are the first to demonstrate that bcl2 is a novel target of rbp2

27008505	 clearly, bcl2 is a new target gene of rbp2, which might mediate a new function of rbp2
27008505	 however, we found that rbp2 directly bound to the bcl2 promoter and induced its transcriptional activation
27008505	 therefore, more evidence and additional studies will be required to determine the acetylation status of the bcl2 promoter and the interaction of rbp2 with histone deacetylase 1 and transcriptional factors such as clock-bmal1

26966728	 to confirm direct involvement of ccne1 and mcm7 genes in cr, further study excluding their genetic expression using small interfering rna or small rna in t24r2 would be experimented like bcl2 gene
26966508	 bcl2 and bbc3 (both p53-upregulated inducers of apoptosis) transcript levels were only nonsignificantly increased throughout the three months of treatments
26964625	 kruppel-like transcription factors, including klf4 and klf5, are rarely affected by genetic alteration during tumorigenesis, but compose key components of the stress response machinery in normal and tumor cells and interact with critical survival pathways, including ras, p53, survivin, and the bcl2 family of cell death regulators
26964625	 currently under clinical investigation are small-molecule inhibitors that target the klf-regulated bcl2 family of antiapoptotic factors
26964625	 obatoclax (gx15-070) and navitoclax (abt-263) are bh3-mimetics that disrupt bcl2 family member protein–protein interactions, thereby enabling enhanced proapoptotic signaling
26964625	 where obatoclax broadly inhibits all the antiapoptotic bcl2 family members with a reduced potency, navitoclax has a high affinity for bcl-2, -xl, and –w (53)

26963814	 however, the expression of bcl2 and bclxl increased only in the crd group
26963814	 one possibility is that bcl2 and bclxl induce autophagy at low initial levels of stress (such as aging and moderate crd) by activating the beclin1-vps34 complex when mitochondria are protected against lethal permeabilization
26963814	 however, at higher, more advanced levels of stress (such as long-term hfd), bcl2 and bclxl induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (momp) [22, 23], thereby initiating the apoptotic cascade[7]
26963814	 the findings of the present study indicated that the expression of beclin1 in islet cells increased in both the hfd and crd intervention groups and that the expression of bcl2 and bclxl increased in only the crd group, which suggests the dissociation of the beclin1/bcl2 complex
26963814	 in the present study (in the context of physiological aging), crd-induced autophagy was markedly different from hfd-induced autophagy, as indicated by the expression of beclin1, bcl2 and bclxl

26960633	 myc and bcl2 rearrangements have been reported in a proportion of dlbcls, where they may be associated with an adverse clinical outcome
26960633	 the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of myc and bcl2 translocations in dlbcl and assess the prognostic impact in dlbcl patients
26960633	 myc and bcl2 rearrangements were investigated by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization on tmas in 97 dlbcls
26960633	 bcl2 rearrangements were observed in 14 of 97 cases
26960633	 bcl2 rearrangement had a worse outcome (p < 0
26960633	 myc and bcl2 rearrangements were observed in 3 of 97 cases with the age of  53 (female), 53, 63 years old, respectively, died in 24, 18, and 35 months after the diagnosis
26960633	 conclusion: we concluded that c-myc and bcl2 may contribute to aggressive transformation, and more mechanism-based therapy should be explored
26960633	 analysis of myc gene rearrangement along with bcl2 is critical in the identification of high-risk patients with poor prognosis
